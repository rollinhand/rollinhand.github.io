# rollinhand.github.io
Jekyll-based Blog.

## Usage
Blog uses a Gemfile and Rakefile for easier writing and viewing new
articles.

If `rake` fails with an undefined error, this means that the current Ruby installation
is missing some libraries. This can be installed with Bundler:

```
sudo gem install bundler
sudo bundle install
```
